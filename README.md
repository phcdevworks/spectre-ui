# Spectre UI

**Spectre UI** is the core styling layer of the **Spectre Suite** — a cross-platform design system built on TailwindCSS and powered by Spectre Tokens.

It provides precompiled CSS, utilities, and styling primitives used by **Spectre Blocks** (WordPress), **Spectre Astro**, **Spectre 11ty**, and future Spectre tools.

> One design system. Many frameworks. Full consistency.
