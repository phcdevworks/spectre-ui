# Spectre UI Agent Guide

This repository is maintained by PHCDevworks and is the implementation layer
between `@phcdevworks/spectre-tokens` and downstream adapters or apps.

## Mission

Turn Spectre tokens into reusable CSS bundles, Tailwind tooling, and type-safe
class recipes without redefining the underlying design values.

## Core Rules

1. Consume tokens instead of inventing local visual values.
2. Keep CSS classes and recipe APIs in sync.
3. Keep recipes framework-agnostic and predictable.
4. Treat hardcoded visual literals as drift unless clearly intentional.
5. Preserve the stable styling contract consumed by adapters and apps.
6. Follow the zero-hex policy unless an exception is deliberate and documented.
7. Prefer isolated, non-breaking micro-evolutions over broad refactors.
8. If a required visual value does not exist in `@phcdevworks/spectre-tokens`,
   stop and document the token gap instead of inventing a fallback.
9. During synchronization work, treat the published NPM package of
   `@phcdevworks/spectre-tokens` as the only authority.
10. Do not mix alignment work with opportunistic feature expansion.
11. Keep every CSS entry point exported from `package.json` standalone,
    distributable, and token-backed, not only the canonical `index.css` bundle.
12. If local component aliases are necessary, keep them as direct mappings from
    upstream token intent rather than package-owned semantic overrides.

## Working Boundaries

- Design values and semantic meaning belong in `@phcdevworks/spectre-tokens`.
- Token-driven CSS, utilities, Tailwind helpers, and class recipes belong here.
- Framework-specific delivery belongs in adapter packages such as
  `@phcdevworks/spectre-ui-astro`.
- Adapters and apps consume `@phcdevworks/spectre-ui`; they should not
  re-implement its styling logic.
- Build tooling and package infrastructure are not part of normal feature,
  hardening, or synchronization tasks unless the scoped task explicitly targets
  them.
- Exported package contracts are in scope when a task touches them. If
  `package.json` exports a CSS or TypeScript entry point, the build must emit a
  real distributable file that matches that contract.

## Change Discipline

- Keep changes atomic and tightly scoped.
- Focus on one clearly bounded UI contract concern at a time.
- For recipe or state hardening work, prefer a blast radius of exactly one CSS
  file and one matching TypeScript recipe file.
- For token synchronization work, update only the local UI files required to
  restore alignment with the published token package.
- Do not expand scope into adapters, runtime components, token authoring, build
  tooling, or infrastructure.
- If alignment introduces a structural conflict, stop and report it instead of
  forcing a workaround.
- Do not invent fallback hex, pixel, or off-contract values to make a change
  pass.

## Standard Workflows

### Micro Hardening

Use this workflow for isolated, non-breaking improvements to the styling
contract.

Typical targets:

- missing standard states such as `disabled` or `loading`
- missing structural variants such as `ghost` or `outline`
- CSS and recipe parity gaps
- small token-driven contract inconsistencies

Default expectations:

- modify one component CSS file
- modify one matching TypeScript recipe file
- keep the change backward-compatible
- stop if the work requires a missing token

### Weekly Synchronization

Use this workflow after a published token release to keep the UI layer aligned.

Authority and scope:

- install `@phcdevworks/spectre-tokens@latest` from NPM
- treat `node_modules/@phcdevworks/spectre-tokens/` as the source of truth
- compare the published package against local `src/styles/` and `src/recipes/`
- update only what is required to restore alignment

Guardrails:

- do not sync from GitHub branches or unpublished local token files
- do not combine synchronization with unrelated cleanup or feature work
- if the token change creates structural conflicts, stop and report the drift
  clearly

## Validation Flow

1. Update source CSS, recipes, or package metadata only as required by the
   scoped task.
2. Run `npm run lint` when the task changes TypeScript, tests, config, or build
   tooling.
3. Run `npm run build` when the task affects package outputs, CSS entry points,
   or token alignment.
4. Run `npm test` after a successful build.
5. Confirm the styling contract remains token-driven, aligned, and non-breaking.
6. Stop immediately and report the issue if validation fails. Do not widen a
   styling task into unrelated tooling work unless the broken tooling blocks the
   scoped contract.

Validation notes:

- Some contract tests read from `dist`, so `npm run build` should complete
  before `npm test`.
- If a CSS entry point is exported from `package.json`, verify that the build
  emits a real standalone file for it and that the file includes the token
  context required to work on its own.

## Governance Rule

Tokens define meaning. UI defines structure. Adapters define delivery.
